The error means the MCP endpoint fails ChatGPT’s connector-specific validation in Teams Developer Mode—most commonly because the required search and fetch tools (or their exact argument/response shapes) are missing or non‑conformant. Teams enforces the connector spec strictly, so a server that “seems to work” in Plus can still be rejected in Teams if it doesn’t match the required tool names and return formats.[1][2][3][4]

### Why it fails in Teams
- ChatGPT connectors only support a narrow MCP profile: exactly two tools named search and fetch for lookup and document retrieval, so missing or renamed tools trigger “doesn’t implement our specification.”[2][4][1]
- The tools must accept single string arguments (search(query: str), fetch(id: str)) and be listed in tools/list; mismatched parameter schemas or extra/alternate tools cause validation failure.[3][4][1]
- Tool results must be returned as a content array with exactly one item of type "text" whose text is a JSON‑encoded string of the required schema; returning raw JSON objects, multiple content items, or non‑text content fails the validator.[1]
- The endpoint must be publicly reachable over the supported transport (HTTP over SSE), and Replit-style URLs must end with /sse/; wrong paths or transient instances often produce spec errors during the handshake.[1]

### Quick compliance checklist
- Tools exist and are named search and fetch in tools/list, each taking a single string argument.[4][3][1]
- search returns one content item type "text" whose text is a JSON‑encoded string shaped like {"results":[{"id","title","url",...}]}.[1]
- fetch returns one content item type "text" whose text is a JSON‑encoded string shaped like {"id","title","text","url","metadata":{...}}.[1]
- Endpoint is stable and ends with /sse/ if using SSE (e.g., Replit), and stays active while testing.[1]
- For deep research/API testing, configure require_approval to “never” so the handshake can complete unattended during validation.[1]

### Why it worked in Plus
- Reports show some environments or other AI clients accept broader MCP toolsets, but ChatGPT connectors validate for the two‑tool search/fetch profile and will reject general‑purpose MCP servers.[5][6][3]
- Help docs explicitly tie this error to connectors that don’t fully meet the required structure, which Teams enforces strictly in the connector flow.[2]

### How to verify quickly
- Hit tools/list and confirm only search and fetch exist with string params; if search is missing/renamed (e.g., listBoards or query), map/alias it to search.[3][4]
- Invoke each tool directly and ensure the result is a content array with a single type "text" item whose text is a JSON‑encoded string matching the documented schemas.[1]
- Use the Responses API deep research example to sanity‑check the MCP server from outside ChatGPT’s UI, ensuring allowed_tools includes search and fetch and the server_url points at the SSE endpoint.[1]

### Common pitfalls to fix
- Returning structured JSON objects instead of JSON‑encoded strings in "text" inside content.[1]
- Returning multiple content items or using non‑text content types.[1]
- Tool names or argument schemas don’t match the required signatures.[4][3]
- Wrong endpoint path or inactive SSE session (e.g., Replit tab not kept open).[1]

### Optional authentication notes
- OpenAI recommends OAuth and dynamic client registration for remote MCP servers; ensure any auth chosen is supported by the connector flow.[1]
- Some Developer Mode discussions note client behavior and auth constraints; if the server requires an unsupported auth flow, switch to OAuth or none for connector validation.[7][1]

### Teams vs Plus at a glance
| Aspect | Teams Developer Mode | Plus |
|---|---|---|
| Validation target | Enforces connector spec with search/fetch only | May appear more lenient depending on flow, but connectors still require search/fetch for compliance [2][4][1] | [3][6][5] |
| Required tools | Exactly search and fetch, single string params | Same for connectors; non‑compliant servers may seem to work in other contexts [2][4][1] | [3][6][5] |
| Return format | Single "text" content item with JSON‑encoded string per tool schema | Same requirement for connector flows [1] | [1] |

Actionable next step: ensure tools/list exposes search and fetch with string args and that each tool returns exactly one type "text" content item whose text is a JSON‑encoded string matching the documented schemas, then reconnect the endpoint ending in /sse/.[2][4][1]
